## Mobile Splash Screen with Animated Image Assembly
This Flutter project demonstrates an animated splash screen where an image breaks into smaller fragments, scatters randomly across the screen, and then reassembles to its original form in the center. The splash screen is named MobileSplash and is fully customizable.

# Features
ðŸŽ¨ Dynamic Animation: An engaging effect where the image fragments animate into their correct positions.
ðŸ”¢ Customizable Grid Size: Adjust how many parts the image is broken into (e.g., 3x3, 4x4).
ðŸ“± Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and web platforms.
ðŸš€ Smooth Transitions: Uses Flutter's AnimatedPositioned and animation curves for high-quality effects.
# Technical Overview
1. Grid-Based Fragmentation
The provided image is divided into smaller rectangular fragments using:
ClipRect for defining each fragment.
Align to position them correctly within the grid.
2. Randomized Initial Positions
Each fragment starts at a random position within the screen using the Random class.
3. Animated Reassembly
Flutterâ€™s AnimatedPositioned widget animates each fragment to its correct position in the grid.
The animation starts as soon as the widget is built.

 # Add Your Image
Place your desired image in the assets folder (e.g., assets/92news.png).
Update your pubspec.yaml file to declare the asset:
yaml
#  How It Works
The MobileSplash screen splits the image into a grid of smaller fragments (gridSize x gridSize).
Initially, these fragments are scattered randomly across the screen.
Using AnimatedPositioned, the fragments move to their correct positions to recreate the original image.
